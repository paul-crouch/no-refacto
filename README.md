# Refactoring Golf

Refactor the code to something nicer!

There is no right answer, it's about getting to a cleaner solution.

Taken from a [refactoring golf exercise](https://github.com/daviddenton/refactoring-golf) by Mr Dave, however, please note the name is deceiving in our fork, this has nothing to do with golf.

## Typescript

You should be good to install node modules and then run tests:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

or run the tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

## If you don't have Node/NPM installed

Please run `./install-nvm.sh` to install NVM and setup your device.
